Hi there!

My name is Igor and I'm iOS developer from Saint-Peterburg, Russia. 
Nice to meet you!

I'm began to develop for iOS in 2014 year. Since the universities do not teach this, I am self-taught. 

In october 2014 I've decided to become professional iOS developer and started to work in SoftwareCenter. The company specialized on out-sourcing development. There I've developed few app for live game application and application for doctors.

When I felt that I want to move further I got into e-Legion. There I was working on few iOS application like Raiffaisen Bank and YOTA. 

Since July 2015 I'm working as a iOS developer at YOTA and develop our iOS client application. Since June 2016 I'm become official member of Typhoon open-source framework. 

If you want invite me to your conference or meetup, I'll be happy to accept your invite.
